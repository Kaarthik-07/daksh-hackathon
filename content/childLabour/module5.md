# Module 5: Prevention Strategies

## Introduction

In Module 5, we will learn about important strategies to stop child labour in our communities. We all have a part to play in ending this harmful practice and making sure all children have a good future. By working together and taking action, we can make a big difference in the fight against child labour.

## Understanding the Role of Communities

Communities are very important in stopping child labour. When people come together and talk about it, they can help make sure kids are safe and can go to school. It's important for everyone in the community to know that children have rights and should be protected.

## Ways Children Can Advocate

Kids have a strong voice and can speak up against child labour. By telling others about it and helping those who need it, kids can make a big difference. It's important to use your voice to help other kids who might be forced to work.

## Organizations Working to Eradicate Child Labour

There are many groups that are working hard to stop child labour and help kids around the world. By learning about these groups and what they do, kids can understand how they can help too. Giving money or time to these groups can really help kids who are in trouble.
