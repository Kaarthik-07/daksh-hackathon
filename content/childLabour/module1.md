## Definition of Child Labour

Child labour is defined as any work that deprives children of their childhood, potential, and dignity, and that is harmful to their physical and mental development. This includes work that is mentally, physically, socially, or morally dangerous and harmful to children. Children engaged in child labour are often denied the opportunity to attend school, play, and enjoy a safe and healthy childhood.

## Prevalence of Child Labour Globally

Child labour is a widespread issue that impacts countries around the world, with millions of children forced to work in hazardous conditions. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), there are an estimated 152 million children engaged in child labour globally, with the majority in the Asia-Pacific region. These children often work in agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and domestic service, facing exploitation, low wages, and long hours.

## Different Forms of Child Labour

Child labour can take many different forms, including:

- Domestic Work: Children working as domestic helpers in private households, often facing abuse and exploitation.
- Agricultural Work: Children working in farms, fields, and plantations, performing physically demanding tasks.
- Manufacturing: Children employed in factories, producing goods for export or local consumption.
- Street Work: Children working on the streets, such as selling goods or begging for money.
