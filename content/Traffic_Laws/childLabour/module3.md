# Module 3: Impact of Child Labour

## Effects on Children's Health

Child labour can make children sick. They might get hurt or become very tired because they have to work a lot. For example, some children work in places with dangerous things that can make them sick, like factories or fields with chemicals. They might not have access to a doctor when they get hurt, which makes it even worse.

## Psychological Impact of Child Labour

Child labour also makes kids feel very sad and scared. They might feel like they have no control over their lives and feel very anxious. They miss out on having fun and learning at school, which can make them feel even worse. Kids who are treated badly at work might feel very low about themselves.

## Long-Term Consequences of Child Labour

Child labour can make it hard for kids to have a good future. If they don't go to school, they might not learn important things they need to know. This means they might not get good jobs when they grow up. People might also treat them badly because they used to work as children. It's important to stop child labour so that kids can have better lives when they grow up.

By understanding how child labour affects children's health, feelings, and future, we can work together to stop it and make sure all kids have a safe and happy childhood.
