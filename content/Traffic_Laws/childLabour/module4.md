# Module 4: Child Rights and Legislation

## International Laws Protecting Children's Rights

Children need special protection because they are vulnerable. There are international laws like the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) that make sure children are safe and treated fairly. These laws say that every child has the right to go to school, stay healthy, and be protected from being forced to work.

## Role of Governments in Preventing Child Labour

Governments have an important job in keeping children safe and happy. They make rules to stop children from being forced to work and to make sure they can go to school instead. Governments should also make sure that kids have what they need to grow up healthy and happy.

## Importance of Education as a Tool to Combat Child Labour

Education is very important for kids. When kids go to school, they learn many things that help them in life. It's also a way to stop child labour because when kids go to school, they have better chances to get good jobs in the future. Education helps kids to understand their rights and speak up for themselves.

**Summary:**

In Module 4, we learned about child rights and laws that protect children from being forced to work. Governments have a big role in making sure kids are safe and educated. Education is key to preventing child labour and helping children have better lives. By understanding these things, kids can help make sure all children are safe, happy, and have the chance to learn and grow.
