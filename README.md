## üèó What We Built

"Dora AI" is not just a project; it's a culmination of our vision for the future of education where legal knowledge is accessible and engaging for children:

- A **comprehensive educational platform** aimed at teaching children about their legal rights through interactive learning experiences.
- An **adaptive learning system** that tailors content difficulty based on the user's performance, ensuring personalized education paths.
- A series of **engaging modules and quizzes** designed to make learning about legal rights both fun and informative.
- A **user-friendly interface** that provides a seamless and intuitive experience for children of ages 8-16 years.
- Utilization of the **GPT-3.5 AI model** to generate educational content and questions, demonstrating the practical use of AI in learning.

## üéì How We Learned

Building "Dora AI" was a learning journey in itself. Here's how we embraced the learning process:

- *Hands-on experience* with cutting-edge technologies like Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS to build the front end of the platform.

## Intel¬Æ oneAPI
Intel¬Æ OneAPI is a comprehensive development platform for building high-performance, cross-architecture applications. It provides a unified programming model, tools, and libraries that allow developers to optimize their applications for Intel¬Æ CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and other hardware. Intel¬Æ OneAPI includes support for popular programming languages like C++, Python, and Fortran, as well as frameworks for deep learning, high-performance computing, and data analytics. With Intel¬Æ OneAPI, developers can build applications that can run on a variety of hardware platforms, and take advantage of the performance benefits of Intel¬Æ architectures.

## Use Of OneApi in our project

In this section, we'll outline how we utilized various Intel¬Æ oneAPI libraries and frameworks to enhance the performance and efficiency of our models.

### Intel¬Æ oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN)

- OneDNN, formerly MKL-DNN, optimizes deep learning primitives for Intel CPUs, enhancing performance through CPU-specific optimizations. It seamlessly integrates with frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and others, improving speed and efficiency for training and inference tasks, especially in computer vision and natural language processing domains
- Hugging Face democratizes AI and NLP with its Transformers library, offering state-of-the-art pre-trained models and tools for tokenization and dataset management.
- Widely adopted by NLP practitioners and researchers, Hugging Face accelerates model development and deployment, facilitating tasks like sentiment analysis, machine translation, and chatbots, while OneDNN enhances deep learning performance on Intel¬†architectures.

**Usage** :
We used hugginface/intel accelerated text-generation model **intel/neural-chat** for acheiving text-generation in our project and achieving better response time and accuracy

## Performance Comparison
The following graphs illustrate the substantial performance improvements achieved by integrating Intel¬Æ oneAPI libraries and frameworks into our models:
